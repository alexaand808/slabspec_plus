# slabspec_plus
add-ons to slabspec for modeling M-band spectra

builds on Colette Salyk's slabspec in the spectools_ir package

- slabspec_convol.py convolves the spectrum with a user-defined velocity profile so as to model, e.g., Keplerian rotation, disk winds, etc

- slabspec_twolayer.py has an absorbing layer in front of a stellar continuum and line emitting region; useful for modeling absorption features
